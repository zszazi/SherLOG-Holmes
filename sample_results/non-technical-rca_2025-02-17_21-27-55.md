## Executive Summary

This report outlines recent issues our systems faced during specific jobs, affecting our network and database services. We experienced failures that impacted our operations, but we are actively addressing these issues to ensure smooth performance in the future.

---

## What Went Wrong?

We investigated two jobs, named **D4E5F6** and **J1K2L3**, which encountered problems due to network connection issues and database access difficulties.

### Job D4E5F6
- **Service Affected:** Our network connection, which is essential for communication between different parts of our system.
- **Failures:** The job failed 12 times, with each failure lasting on average about 5 minutes. The main issue detected was **high delays in our network**, which can happen when too many requests are made simultaneously or if there are disruptions in the network.

### Job J1K2L3
- **Service Affected:** Our database service, which stores important information.
- **Failures:** This job failed 8 times, also taking around 5 minutes on average to resolve. The main problem was **connection issues**, possibly due to restrictions in our security settings.

---

## Why Did This Happen?

1. **Network Issues:**
   - We observed high delays (50 milliseconds) in our network, indicating possible congestion or too many requests at once.
   - Some connections were completely lost, suggesting interruptions in service.

2. **Database Access Problems:**
   - Slow responses and connection failures pointed to potential **firewall settings** that may not have allowed the necessary traffic to flow.

---

## How Are We Fixing It?

We are taking immediate steps to resolve these issues:

1. **Monitoring:**
   - We are enhancing our network monitoring to catch problems as they arise. This means we can act quickly when something goes wrong.

2. **Firewall Review:**
   - Our team is reviewing and adjusting the firewall settings to ensure all necessary connections are allowed, especially for our database.

3. **Performance Improvements:**
   - We are looking into increasing our network capacity and optimizing our application processes to handle traffic better.

---

## Next Steps

- **Ongoing Monitoring:** We will implement continuous monitoring systems to keep an eye on network and database performance.
- **Regular Updates:** We will keep you updated on our progress and any improvements to our systems.
- **Feedback Loop:** We encourage feedback from stakeholders to ensure our solutions meet everyone's needs effectively.
