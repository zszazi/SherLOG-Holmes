# Root Cause Analysis Report

## Report Generated: 2025-06-30

### Overview
This report aims to simplify the analysis of recent failures affecting our network services. Specifically, we will look into two job IDs (D4E5F6 and J1K2L3) that encountered issues. Our focus is on understanding what went wrong, why it happened, and how we are addressing these problems.

### Summary of Issues

#### JobID: D4E5F6
- **Affected Service:** HTTPS (secure web traffic)
- **Location:** IP Address 192.168.1.2
- **Failures Recorded:** 10 instances of failure
- **Key Observations:**
  - Failures occurred rapidly, suggesting a consistent connection issue.
  - The reported latency (delay in response) was 50ms, which is higher than expected.

- **Network Events:**
  - **Critical Alerts:**
    - Multiple connection timeouts and a permanent loss of connection were noted, indicating a significant issue.

#### JobID: J1K2L3
- **Affected Service:** MySQL (database service)
- **Location:** IP Address 192.168.1.4
- **Failures Recorded:** 10 instances of failure
- **Key Observations:**
  - Similar to the previous job, failures happened in quick succession, hinting at connectivity problems.
  - Latency was measured at 30ms, which is acceptable, but still raised concerns in certain situations.

- **Network Events:**
  - **Critical Alerts:**
    - Slow responses and a sudden termination of the connection were observed, suggesting possible firewall issues.

### What Went Wrong
Both job IDs experienced a series of failures attributed to network issues. The first job (D4E5F6) faced high latency and connection drops, while the second job (J1K2L3) reported potential firewall restrictions affecting its database connection.

### Why It Happened
- **Network Congestion:** High latency indicates that data was slow to travel across the network, possibly due to congestion.
- **Firewall Settings:** The MySQL service may have faced restrictions from firewall rules that blocked legitimate access attempts.

### What We Are Doing to Fix It
1. **Network Improvements:** We are investigating the sources of latency and congestion to enhance performance.
2. **Firewall Review:** Our team will review and adjust firewall settings to ensure they allow proper access to the MySQL service.
3. **Monitoring Enhancements:** We are implementing better monitoring tools to catch these issues early and respond quickly.

### Reassurance
We understand that these issues can impact your experience and our business operations. Please rest assured that we are actively working to resolve these problems. Our priority is to ensure the reliability of our services moving forward.
