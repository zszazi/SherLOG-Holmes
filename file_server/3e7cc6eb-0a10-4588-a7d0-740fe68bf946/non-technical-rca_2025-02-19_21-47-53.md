## Detailed Analysis of Failures

### JobID: D4E5F6  
**Service Type:** Network Service (TCP on Port 443)  
**IP Address:** 192.168.1.2  

#### Issue Summary:
- **Total Failures:** 10
- **Average Latency:** 50ms (indicating slower response times and possible network congestion).
- **Failure Occurrence:** Multiple failures occurred within just a few seconds.

#### What Happened:
There were repeated failures in this network service, suggesting that the connections were slow or congested. This could mean that too much data was trying to pass through a single point, causing delays and ultimately failures in completing tasks.

### JobID: J1K2L3  
**Service Type:** Database Service (MySQL on Port 3306)  
**IP Address:** 192.168.1.4  

#### Issue Summary:
- **Total Failures:** 10
- **Average Latency:** 30ms (noted as slow response).
- **Possible Cause:** Issues with firewall settings restricting connections.

#### What Happened:
This database service faced connection issues, which could have been caused by settings in the firewall that blocked necessary communication. Additionally, slower response times suggest that the database was struggling to keep up with requests.
